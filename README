NAME
    Audio::Extract::PCM - Extract PCM data from audio files

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This module's purpose is to extract PCM data from various audio formats.
    PCM is the format in that you send data to your sound card driver. This
    module aims to provide a single interface for PCM extraction from
    various audio formats, compressed and otherwise.

    Currently the implementation makes use of the external "sox" program. As
    of 2008, sox's supported input formats include "wav", "mp3",
    "ogg/vorbis", "flac", if you have compiled sox with support for them,
    but does not include support for "wma".

    I have chosen the use of "sox" for the first implementation of this
    module because it already has an abstract interface to many formats.
    However I plan to include more implementations to (1) maybe include more
    formats, (2) make the implementation more perlish and (3) make the
    module more portable. CPAN has specialized modules like Audio::Mad and
    Ogg::Vorbis::Decoder, to which I could implement an abstract interface.

    If you have suggestions how to include more implementations, or if you
    simply need them and want to motivate me, please contact me.

    Usage example:

        use Audio::PCM::Extract;
        my $extractor = Audio::PCM::Extract->new('song.ogg');
        my $pcm = $extractor->pcm(44100, 2, 2) or die $extractor->error;

METHODS
  new
    Parameters: "filename"

    Constructs a new object to access the specified file.

  pcm
    Parameters: "frequency", "samplesize", "channels"

    Extracts PCM data.

    The sample size is specified in bytes, so 2 means 16 bit sound.

    Returns the pcm data as a string, or an empty list in case of an error
    (cf. "error").

  error
    Returns the last error that occured for this object.
