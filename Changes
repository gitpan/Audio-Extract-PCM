0.02    2008-12-20

        Return the pcm data as a reference.

0.02_01 2008-12-21     
        Warn for sox warnings.
        Check for sox program in Build.PL
        extract.t: Create sine.wav in base directory, not in t/, because of
            permission problems.

        Don't use IO::CaptureOutput in Build.PL, backticks will suffice here (we
        need it anyway to run the module, but Build.PL is better kept simple.)
